      "William, age 30, came to see the doctor because he wanted a \ndate.  He had never had a date in his life and was very \nfrustrated by his inability to meet and successfully ask a  \nwoman on a date.  <p> During the doctor's evaluation William said he was \nat a loss as to what his problem was.  His mother, who was in \nthe room at the time, had her own opinions regarding William's problem.  \nWilliam, she said, misreads situations by misinterpreting facial signals by his prospective dates. <p>\n  <i>\"He has always done so.  Sometimes he comes on too strong, sometimes he is \nwithdrawn when another person is interested.\n  He doesn't read \nthe tone of my voice correctly either.  I can be really mad at him \nand he doesn't take me seriously.  Or he can think I'm mad when \nI'm not,\" </i>she says. \n      <br>The physician is concerned that an area of William's brain is most likely to be malfunctioning, thereby causing his social problems by causing William to misinterpret facial signals by his prospective dates. He decides to investigate further by doing a more detailed scan on his brain, which shows an abnormal part of the brain, as shown in yellow. \n\t <br><br>    Please click image button below to view image<br/>He also had a SPECT scan, which confirmed that this  particular part of his  brain, as highlighted in yellow, in the location as suspected by the physician, was abnormal. <p>"

    "explanation": [
      "William's SPECT showed marked decreased activity in his right temporal lobe; his left temporal lobe was fine.\n\nThe intervention that was most effective for William was intensive social skills training. He worked with a psychologist who coached him on facial expressions, voice tones, and proper social etiquette. He had his first date 6 months after coming to the clinic."
